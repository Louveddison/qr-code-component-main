## My process
To make this project, I first created an HTML file with the classic encoding data, the language and the font I'm going to use. 

Then I decided to implement the image first, giving it an id attribute so that I could isolate it when I modified its properties in the CSS pane. 

For the text, I decided to first use an h3 tag to respect the structure of the document and give it a bold appearance, as you can see on the document.

I then separated the background and our work base with a div tag so that we could work on them in our CSS file. 

As for our CSS file, I first modified the body of the page by giving it different properties, then I modified the image by twisting the edges and modifying the width and height.

I then attacked the div tag, modifying its borders, color, margins, height, width, etc., so as to give it an isolated appearance with a drop shadow.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit

### What I learned

This project/challenge enabled me to master HTML & CSS and apply different styles to my code. 
The idea here was to create a QR code linking to my GitHub and FrontEndMentor site.
For a beginner like me, the challenge was a success.

### Continued development

for my future career I need to consolidate my knowledge of styling multiple elements in CSS
